# Image-Stitching
This Project is to capture multiple individual images and stitch them digitally using python codes. Ideally the image capturing is done using USB cameras connected to Raspberry-pi board triggered using the .sh files.

The files "EDL Project.pptx" and "EE334 Final Report.pdf" files contain the in-depth details of the project. Also, feel free to check out the "output-examples", which contains some of the example images stitched with the given python codes.
