# Image-Stitching
This Project is to capture multiple individual images and stitch them digitally using python codes. Ideally the image capturin is done using USB cameras connected to Raspberry-pi board triggered using the .sh files.

The files "EDL Project.pptx" and "EE334 EDL Report.docx" files contain the in depth details if the project. Also, feel free to check out the "output-examples", which contains some of the example images stitched with the given python codes.
